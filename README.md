# Hermitation
First Party Isolation extension for Firefox.

## Features
- Clicking the popup icons allows to enable or disable First Party Isolation on the fly.
- Allows to remember previous state of the FPI, or enable/disable it by defeault.
- Domain whitelisting

#### Please note
Domain whitelisting is purely experimental. Firefox's FPI setting is global, so at this point there's no guarantee it can be triggered on/off fast enough when switching tabs.
